In this report we analyzed the effects of the Space Environment on the ESA Cluster-II Mission, especially focused on the radiation effects on one of the four satellites, FM-8 Tango.
In order to provide proper constraints for the analysis, the orbit of the satellite was analysed, with respect to the pervaded regions of the magneto- and plasmasphere of the Earth.

Using these constraints, a tool developed by ESA, SPENVIS, was used to determine various values by simulating the space environment.
Amongst others, the environmental flux and the total ionising dose was investigated, which are crucial for shielding calculations concerning solar panels and memory devices.

Finally, four different volatile-memory devices were analysed to determine a suitable device for the duration of the mission, which means the Single Upset Event rates were estimated by using different techniques and tools.
